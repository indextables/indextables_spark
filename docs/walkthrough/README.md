# IndexTables4Spark Code Walkthrough

This walkthrough describes the structure of the IndexTables4Spark source tree and the purpose of each module. It is written to orient a new reader: it explains what each package is for, what the individual source files inside it do, and how the modules connect to each other.

IndexTables4Spark is an Apache Spark DataSource V2 connector that turns a Spark table into a high-performance, full-text-searchable index backed by [Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) (via the `tantivy4java` JNI binding). A table is stored as a collection of immutable Quickwit `.split` files plus a Delta-Lake-style `_transaction_log/`. Read and write paths run entirely inside Spark executors — there is no server process.

## Reading order

Each chapter is self-contained but they build on each other:

1. [01 — Entry Points](01-entry-points.md) — the public provider and extension classes Spark loads first.
2. [02 — Read Path](02-read-path.md) — how a `spark.read` call becomes a scan, gets pushdown, and returns `ColumnarBatch`es.
3. [03 — Write Path](03-write-path.md) — how a `df.write.save()` call becomes split files and a committed transaction.
4. [04 — Transaction Log](04-transaction-log.md) — the Delta-style log that is the source of truth for table state.
5. [05 — Search Engine](05-search-engine.md) — the Tantivy facade, query parsing, filters, and FFI bridges.
6. [06 — Storage and Merge I/O](06-storage-io.md) — cloud storage abstraction and the async merge I/O pipeline.
7. [07 — Merge, Purge, Prewarm](07-merge-and-purge.md) — post-commit maintenance subsystems.
8. [08 — SQL Commands](08-sql-commands.md) — the `INDEXTABLES`/`TANTIVY4SPARK` SQL extension.
9. [09 — Companion Sync](09-sync-companion.md) — building search companions for external Delta/Parquet/Iceberg tables.
10. [10 — Config, Auth, Utilities](10-config-auth-util.md) — cross-cutting infrastructure.

## How the pieces fit together

A one-paragraph mental model:

> When Spark loads the data source, `provider/IndexTablesProvider` is instantiated. Reads flow through `core/IndexTables4SparkScanBuilder` → `core/IndexTables4SparkScan` → one of the columnar `*PartitionReader`s, which use `search/SplitSearchEngine` to query `.split` files and return data via `arrow/ArrowFfiBridge`. Writes flow through `core/IndexTables4SparkWriteBuilder` → `IndexTables4SparkOptimizedWrite`/`StandardWrite` → `IndexTables4SparkArrowDataWriter`, which exports rows via `arrow/ArrowFfiWriteBridge` into Tantivy. Every read and write consults the `transaction/` log for file listings and commits. Filter and aggregation pushdown is coordinated by `catalyst/` rules plus `filters/`, `expressions/`, and `json/JsonPredicateTranslator`. Storage is abstracted behind `io/CloudStorageProvider`. Post-commit maintenance (merge-on-write, purge-on-write, prewarm) runs through singletons in `merge/`, `purge/`, and `prewarm/`. SQL extensions in `sql/` add operational commands, and `sync/` builds companion indexes over foreign Delta/Parquet/Iceberg tables.

Subsequent chapters zoom in on each of those responsibilities.
